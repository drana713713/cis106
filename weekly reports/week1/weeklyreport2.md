# Week Report 2
## Summary of Presentations
### The Basics of Virtualization 
#### What is Virtualization?
**Virtualization** - replication of hardware to simulate a virtual machine inside a physical machine
#### Types of Virtualization
* Server-side virtualization 
* Client-side virtualization
* The basic difference between the two is **where the virtualizing takes place**

##### Server-side virtualization 
Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)
* Thick client or fat client
* Thin client 
* Zero client

##### Client-side virtualization
* Software installed on a computer to manage virtual machines
* For client-side virtualization, the computer needs:
  * **hypervisor** - software that allows the management of virtual machines)
  * Hardware support
    * capable CPU
    * enough RAM & storage

###### Type 1 vs Type 2 Hypervisor
* **Type 1** - runs on the hardware
* **Type 2** - runs on a host operating system

#### Benefits of Virtualization 
* Allows running multiple OSs on one machine
* Allows applications to be tested before installing them on a host machine
* Reduces costs by decreasing the physical hardware that must be purchased for a network
* Offers the chance to experiment with untested programs without infecting host machines with viruses or other malware

#### VirtualBox
**Virtualbox** - is a powerful type 2 virtualization product for enterprise as well as home use

#### Computer Virtualization Requirements
* AMD V or INTEL V compatible processor
* Dual core x64 processor with 1.3 GHz or faster 4GB of RAM
* Enough free hard drive space for installing guest OSs.

### What is Raspberry Pi? 
* Raspberry PI - a low cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs into a computer monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and mouse. 

#### Raspberry Pi Foundation 
* The Raspberry Pi Foundation is a registered educational charity based in the UK, and their goal was to advance education in the field of computer science and related subjects. 

#### Different Models of Raspberry Pi

* **Raspberry Pi 4**

* **Raspberry Pi 400**
  * Has the same components as Raspberry Pi 4 placed inside a keyboard housing
  * Great choice for those who will be using Pi as an everyday computer.
